Hi, John 

Recently, I received a check from OSSIPEE for SO 12887 , but there is no match invoice. I realized that we might need to communicate about the points below   

1)      When a SO is completed, sales person shouldn’t physically turn the order status from “on order” to “completed” 

2)      The right procedure is, to advise the logistical manger Tadas the order is completed. Tadas is the only authorized person to convert delivered sale order. Once, he created a shipment for the delivered order , I will get an auto-gendered invoice from the system for your customer

Would you please participate with the procedure above, thank you !
